<h1>Mediawiki</h1>
Used Helm charts for mediawiki to deploy on Azure Kubernetes services (AKS).

In this assignment, I have added 4 environments ( Dev, Integration, operations & test ) for enhancing the deployment for different environments using Azure DevOps End to End automation.

<h1>Pre-requisites:</h1>
Using Pre-cluster-config-steps.yml file used ( /pipelines/templates/steps ), installing az cli, kubectl & helm on the Azure DevOps Yaml pipeline agent. 
The agent pool is added for each environment under path: Thoughtworks_Arko\pipelines\templates\vars\cd-release-vars.yml.

Each environment values.yaml files present in path: Thoughtworks_Arko\Apps_conf\AKS\environments
Also, for security scanning on the K8s cluster, I have used CheckOV, which is an Open-Source antivirus engine for detecting trojans, viruses, malware & other malicious threats.

<h1>Pipeline End to End Automation steps:</h1>
The repo contains three charts: ( Path: Thoughtworks_Arko\Apps_conf\AKS\Helm )

1) ClamAV -> To detect  trojans, viruses, malware for docker containers running on cluster

2) mediawiki -> It runs mediawiki app

3) mariadb -> It runs database for mediawiki app

Now, Using Aure DevOps Yaml pipeline (End to End Automation), Needs to trigger the cd-release.yml file (Path: Thoughtworks_Arko\pipelines\cd-release.yml). So, whenever there is a change in code or a pull requests trigger the pipeline as well.
In the powershell (path: Thoughtworks_Arko\Apps_conf\AKS\ConfigureCluster.ps1) -> As per the desired environment required, the script will perform to configure each environment with proper subscriptionID to deploy ClamAV Antivirus, then install mediawiki app and finally install the mariadb using helm.

As per the pipeline, it will build the Dockerfile and push the images to Azure Container Registry (ACR). Next it will run the powershell script which contains the helm install command to deploy the application.

**Note:** The secrets (password for DB) are stored in Key-Vault of Azure and itâ€™s been retrieved in the PowerShell script while running the helm install commands.

**Note**: For scalling up the application, I have used Horizontal Pod Autoscaller (HPA)
